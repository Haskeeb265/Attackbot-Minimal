"""
Neo4j graph schema for the Attackbot_v2 recon pipeline (Stage 1).

The graph is the *system of record* for all recon findings (recon.md §6).
This module is the Python home of the schema proposed in the design review and
stands in for the plan's suggested `graph/schema.cypher` file
(IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Stage 1 — "Schema definition mechanism"). The
constraints/indexes below are idempotent Cypher (`CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`)
and can be applied at the start of any run or by a test fixture via
:func:`apply_schema`.

Design decisions (each traced to evidence):

* **Multi-label nodes.** Every asset carries the base `:Asset` label *plus* a
  typed label (`:Domain`, `:IP`, `:URL`, ...). The base label keeps cross-type
  queries uniform ("all assets related to org X"); the typed labels give
  type-specific indexes.  (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Stage 1; recon.md §6)
* **Canonical identity.** Every write is an idempotent `MERGE` keyed on
  `(asset_type, canonical_value)` where `canonical_value` is the S3-normalized
  value (lowercase, punycode, trailing-dot strip, IP canonicalization).
  (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §4.4 + Stage 1 + Stage 3)
* **Organization anchor.** `(:Organization {handle})` is the anchor all seeds
  `BELONGS_TO`; cross-program correlation (`RELATED_TO`) is a later refinement.
  (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Stage 4)
* **Provenance on edges, not nodes.** Every edge carries
  `(source, tool, observed_at, confidence)` plus an optional `signal` for
  evidence-bearing edges (maps to the recon.md §7 scoring signal table).
  (recon.md §6; IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Stage 1)
* **Scoring state as indexed properties.** `score`, `state`, `state_changed_at`
  live on the node for fast tier queries (recon.md §7 thresholds);
  `score_audit` is a serialized snapshot of the S2 ScoreAudit, kept for run-end
  explainability (why a node scored as it did) and optional later replay.
  (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Stages 2, 7)
* **No redundant indexes.** `:Asset(asset_type)` alone would duplicate the
  leftmost prefix of the composite identity constraint, and `:Organization(handle)`
  is backed by its unique constraint — both omitted per the scope.md §4.7
  leftmost-prefix lesson applied to Neo4j.
* **Mode: one-shot (v1).** The pipeline runs to completion per invocation —
  recursion, scoring, and graph writes all happen *during* the run, and scores
  freeze at observation time. The plan's continuous machinery (S8 Redis cache,
  S9 workers, S11 background decay/pruning, S14 differential monitoring) is
  deferred. The schema is deliberately mode-agnostic: MERGE identity makes
  re-runs safe, and the deferred stages can be layered back on with no schema
  migration.

> **NOTE (resolved):** the CRUD in ``repository.py``
> (``merge_node``/``get_node``/``merge_relation``/``get_relation``) accepts a
> **list** of labels (``labels: Sequence[str]``) and emits multi-label nodes
> like ``(:Asset:Domain)``. Write real assets with ``labels=["Asset", "Domain"]``
> (base label first) so the ``:Asset`` identity constraint below is exercised by
> every write; ``tests/recon/test_repository.py`` asserts the constraint rejects
> duplicate ``(asset_type, canonical_value)`` pairs.

v1 core graph:

> **Fallback for unknown asset types:** when an asset arrives with a type not
> covered by the typed labels above (e.g. HackerOne ``OTHER``, or a future
> pipeline type not yet defined), it is written as ``(:Asset:Other)`` with just
> the base ``:Asset`` label plus the generic ``:Other`` typed label. The
> identity constraint ``(asset_type, canonical_value)`` still fires, so
> idempotency is preserved. The relationship to its ``:Organization`` anchor
> uses ``BELONGS_TO`` (same as any seed), and correlations with other assets
> use ``FOUND_IN``. This ensures no scope type is silently dropped, and the
> typed label can be refined to a dedicated label later when a pipeline
> arrives without breaking existing queries."

#       (:Asset:Other)-[:BELONGS_TO {source: "HackerOne"}]->(:Organization {handle})
#
#   * FOUND_IN   — reserved for correlated occurrences found during pipeline
#     runs where the relationship type is genuinely ambiguous. Both endpoints
#     carry :Asset, and the edge includes standard provenance properties.
#
# This ensures unknown assets are linkable and queryable without a schema
# migration. The specific typed rels above are preferred when the asset types
# are known.
